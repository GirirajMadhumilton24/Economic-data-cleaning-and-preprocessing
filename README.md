# Economic Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

This Jupyter Notebook provides a structured approach to cleaning and preprocessing economic data, ensuring data integrity for further analysis and modeling. It addresses key data challenges such as missing values, duplicates, and standardization, making the dataset ready for advanced analytical tasks.

## Key Features

- **Identification and Handling of Missing Values**: Efficiently handles missing data to maintain dataset quality.
- **Removal of Duplicate Records**: Ensures the dataset is free of redundant information, improving accuracy.
- **Standardization of Data Formats**: Ensures consistency in data formatting for easier analysis.
- **Encoding of Categorical Variables**: Prepares categorical variables for analytical models by encoding them appropriately.
- **Normalization and Scaling of Numerical Data**: Adjusts numerical data ranges to enhance model performance.
- **Detection and Treatment of Outliers**: Identifies and addresses outliers that may skew results.

## Prerequisites

Ensure the following Python libraries are installed before executing the notebook:

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler, LabelEncoder
```

## Usage Instructions

1. **Load the Dataset**: Load the economic dataset into the notebook.
2. **Execute Each Cell Sequentially**: Follow the steps in the notebook to apply data cleaning and preprocessing methods.
3. **Export the Cleaned Dataset**: Once the preprocessing is done, export the cleaned dataset for further exploratory data analysis (EDA) or machine learning applications.

## Output

After executing the notebook, you will have a cleaned and preprocessed dataset, optimized for robust analysis and predictive modeling.
